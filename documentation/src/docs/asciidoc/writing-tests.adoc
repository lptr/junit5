[[writing-tests-annotations]]
=== Annotations

JUnit Jupiter supports the following annotations for configuring tests and extending the framework.

All core annotations are located in the `{api-package}` package in the `junit-jupiter-api`
module.

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Annotation         | Description

| `@Test`            | Denotes that a method is a test method. Unlike JUnit 4's `@Test` annotation, this annotation does not declare any attributes, since test extensions in JUnit Jupiter operate based on their own dedicated annotations.
| `@TestFactory`     | Denotes that a method is a test factory for <<writing-tests-dynamic-tests, dynamic tests>>
| `@DisplayName`     | Declares a custom display name for the test class or test method
| `@BeforeEach`      | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _before_ *each* `@Test` method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4's `@Before`. Such methods are _inherited_.
| `@AfterEach`       | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _after_ *each* `@Test` method in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4's `@After`. Such methods are _inherited_.
| `@BeforeAll`       | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _before_ *all* `@Test` methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4's `@BeforeClass`. Such methods must be `static` and are _inherited_.
| `@AfterAll`        | Denotes that the annotated method should be executed _after_ *all* `@Test` methods in the current class; analogous to JUnit 4's `@AfterClass`. Such methods must be `static` and are _inherited_.
| `@Nested`          | Denotes that the annotated class is a nested, non-static test class. Due to restrictions of the Java language, `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` methods cannot be used in a `@Nested` test class.
| `@Tag`             | Used to declare _tags_ for filtering tests, either at the class or method level; analogous to test groups in TestNG or Categories in JUnit 4
| `@Disabled`        | Used to _disable_ a test class or test method; analogous to JUnit 4's `@Ignore`
| `@ExtendWith`      | Used to register custom <<extensions,extensions>>
|===

[[writing-tests-meta-annotations]]
==== Meta-Annotations and Composed Annotations

JUnit Jupiter annotations can be used as _meta-annotations_. That means that you can define
your own _composed annotation_ that will automatically _inherit_ the semantics of its
meta-annotations.

For example, instead of copying and pasting `@Tag("fast")` throughout your code base (see
<<writing-tests-tagging-and-filtering>>), you can create a custom _composed annotation_ named `@Fast`
as follows. `@Fast` can then be used as a drop-in replacement for `@Tag("fast")`.

[[writing-tests-assertions]]
=== Assertions

JUnit Jupiter comes with many of the assertion methods that JUnit 4 has and adds a few
that lend themselves well to being used with Java 8 lambdas. All JUnit Jupiter assertions
are `static` methods in the `{Assertions}` class.

[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/AssertionsDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

[[writing-tests-assertions-third-party]]
==== Third-party Assertion Libraries

Even though the assertion facilities provided by JUnit Jupiter are sufficient for many
testing scenarios, there are times when more power and additional functionality such as
_matchers_ are desired or required. In such cases, the JUnit team recommends the use of
third-party assertion libraries such as {AssertJ}, {Hamcrest}, {Truth}, etc. Developers
are therefore free to use the assertion library of their choice.

For example, the combination of _matchers_ and a fluent API can be used to make
assertions more descriptive and readable. However, JUnit Jupiter's `{Assertions}` class
does not provide an
http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/Assert.html#assertThat[`assertThat()`]
method like the one found in JUnit 4's `org.junit.Assert` class which accepts a Hamcrest
http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/hamcrest/Matcher.html[`Matcher`]. Instead,
developers are encouraged to use the built-in support for matchers provided by third-party
assertion libraries.

The following example demonstrates how to use the `assertThat()` support from Hamcrest in
a JUnit Jupiter test. As long as the Hamcrest library has been added to the classpath,
you can statically import methods such as `assertThat()`, `is()`, and `equalTo()` and
then use them in tests like in the `assertWithHamcrestMatcher()` method below.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----

Naturally, legacy tests based on the JUnit 4 programming model can continue using
`org.junit.Assert#assertThat`.

[[writing-tests-assumptions]]
=== Assumptions

JUnit Jupiter comes with a subset of the assumption methods that JUnit 4 provides and adds a
few that lend themselves well to being used with Java 8 lambdas. All JUnit Jupiter assumptions

include::{testDir}/example/TestingAStackDemo.java[tags=user_guide]

NOTE: _Only non-static nested classes_ (i.e. _inner classes_) can serve as
`@Nested` tests. Nesting can be arbitrarily deep, and those inner classes are considered
to be full members of the test class family with one exception: `@BeforeAll` and
`@AfterAll` do not work, because Java does not allow `static` members in inner classes.

[[writing-tests-dependency-injection]]
=== Dependency Injection for Constructors and Methods

In all prior JUnit versions, test constructors or methods were not allowed to have
parameters (at least not with the standard `Runner` implementations). As one of the major
changes in JUnit Jupiter, both test constructors and methods are now permitted to have
parameters. This allows for greater flexibility and enables _Dependency Injection_ for
constructors and methods.

`{ParameterResolver}` defines the API for test extensions that wish to _dynamically_
resolve parameters at runtime. If a test constructor or a `@Test`, `@TestFactory`,
`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, or `@AfterAll` method accepts a parameter, the
parameter must be resolved at runtime by a registered `ParameterResolver`.

There are currently two built-in resolvers that are registered automatically.

* `{TestInfoParameterResolver}`: if a method parameter is of type `{TestInfo}`, the
  `TestInfoParameterResolver` will supply an instance of `TestInfo` corresponding to the
  current test as the value for the parameter. The `TestInfo` can then be used to retrieve
  information about the current test such as the test's display name, the test class, the
  test method, or associated tags. The display name is either a technical name, such as
  the name of the test class or test method, or a custom name configured via `@DisplayName`.
+
`{TestInfo}` acts as a drop-in replacement for the `TestName`
rule from JUnit 4. Here is an example of its usage.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/TestInfoDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

* `{TestReporterParameterResolver}`: if a method parameter is of type `{TestReporter}`, the
  `TestReporterParameterResolver` will supply an instance of `TestReporter`.
  The `TestReporter` can be used to publish additional data about the current test run.
  The data can be consumed through `{TestExecutionListener}.reportingEntryPublished()` and thus
  be viewed by IDEs or included in reports.
+
In JUnit Jupiter you should use `TestReporter` where
you used to print information to `stdout` or `stderr` in JUnit 4.
Using `@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)` will even output all reported entries to `stdout`.

[subs="verbatim"]

NOTE: Other parameter resolvers must be explicitly enabled by registering appropriate
<<extensions,extensions>> via `@ExtendWith`.

Check out the `{MockitoExtension}` for an example of a custom `{ParameterResolver}`.
While not intended to be production-ready, it demonstrates the simplicity and
expressiveness of both the extension model and the parameter resolution process.
`MyMockitoTest` demonstrates how to inject Mockito mocks into `@BeforeEach` and `@Test`
methods.

[[writing-tests-test-interfaces-and-default-methods]]
=== Test Interfaces and Default Methods

JUnit Jupiter allows `@Test`, `@TestFactory`, `@BeforeEach`, and `@AfterEach` to be
declared on interface default methods. In addition, `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` can be
declared on static methods in a test interface, while `@ExtendWith` and `@Tag` can be
declared on test interfaces to configure extensions and tags. Here are some examples.

[source,java]

----

[source,java]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/testinterface/TestInterfaceDynamicTestsDemo.java[tags=user_guide]
----

`@ExtendWith` and `@Tag` can be declared on a test interface so that classes that
implement it automatically inherit its tags and extensions. See
<<extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-before-after-execution>> for the source code of the
<<extensions-lifecycle-callbacks-timing-extension, TimingExtension>>.

[source,java]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/testinterface/TimeExecutionLogger.java[tags=user_guide]
----

In your test class you can then implement these test interfaces to have them applied.

[source,java]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/testinterface/TestInterfaceDemo.java[tags=user_guide]

Running the `TestInterfaceDemo` results in output similar to the following:

Another possible application of this feature is to write tests for interface contracts.
For example, you can write tests for how implementations of `Object.equals` or
`Comparable.compareTo` should behave as follows.

----

In your test class you can then implement both contract interfaces thereby inheriting the
corresponding tests. Of course you'll have to implement the abstract methods.

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests]]
=== Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests make it possible to run a test multiple times with different arguments. They are declared just like regular `@Test` methods, but use the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation instead. In addition, you must declare at least one _source_ that will provide the arguments for each invocation.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=first_example]
----

This parameterized test uses the `@ValueSource` annotation to specify a `String` array as the source of arguments. When executing this method, each invocation will be reported separately. For instance, the `ConsoleLauncher` will print output similar to the following.

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-setup]]
==== Required Setup

In order to use parameterized tests you need to add a dependency to the `junit-jupiter-params` artifact. Please refer to <<dependency-metadata>> for details.

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources]]
==== Sources of Arguments

Out of the box, JUnit Jupiter already provides quite a few _source_ annotations. The following subsections provide a brief overview and an example for each of them. Please refer to the Javadoc in the `{params-provider-package}` package for additional information.

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-ValueSource]]
===== @ValueSource

`@ValueSource` is one of the simplest possible sources. It lets you specify an array of literals of primitive types (either `String`, `int`, `long`, or `double`) and can only be used for providing a single parameter per invocation.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=ValueSource_example]
----

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-EnumSource]]
===== @EnumSource

`@EnumSource` provides a convenient way to use `Enum` constants. The annotation provides an optional `names` parameter that lets you specify which constants shall be used. If omitted, all constants will be used like in the following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=EnumSource_example]
----

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-MethodSource]]
===== @MethodSource

`@MethodSource` allows to refer to one or multiple methods of the test class. Each method must return a `Stream`, an `Iterable`, an `Iterator`, or an array of arguments. In addition, each method must be `static` and don't use any parameters.

If you only need a single parameter, you can return instances of the parameter type directly as demonstrated by the following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=simple_MethodSource_example]
----

In case you need multiple parameters, you need to return `Argument` instances as shown below.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=multi_arg_MethodSource_example]
----

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-CsvSource]]
===== @CsvSource

`@CsvSource` allows to express argument lists as comma-separated `String` literals.

[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=CsvSource_example]
----

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-CsvFileSource]]
===== @CsvFileSource

`@CsvFileSource` lets you use CSV files from the classpath. Each line leads to one invocation of the parameterized test.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]

The used `two-column.csv` file could look like this.

----


[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion]]
==== Argument Conversion

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit]]
===== Implicit Conversion

To support use cases like `@CsvSource`, JUnit Jupiter provides a number of built-in implicit conversions. The conversion process depends on the declared type of each method parameter.

For example, if a `@ParameterizedTest` declares a parameter of type `TimeUnit` and the actual type supplied by the declared source is a `String`, it will automatically be converted into the corresponding enum constant.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=implicit_conversion_example]
----

`String` instances are currently implicitly converted to the following target types.

[cols="10,90"]
|===
| Target Type | Example

| `boolean`/`Boolean` | `"true"` → `true`
| `byte`/`Byte` | `"1"` → `(byte) 1`
| `char`/`Character` | `"o"` → `'o'`
| `short`/`Short` | `"1"` → `(short) 1`
| `int`/`Integer` | `"1"` → `1`
| `long`/`Long` | `"1"` → `1L`
| `float`/`Float` | `"1.0"` → `1.0f`
| `double`/`Double` | `"1.0"` → `1.0d`
| `Enum` subclass | `"SECONDS"` → `TimeUnit.SECONDS`
| `java.time.Instant` | `"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"` → `Instant.ofEpochMilli(0)`
| `java.time.LocalDate` | `"2017-03-14"` → `LocalDate.of(2017, 3, 14)`
| `java.time.LocalDateTime` | `"2017-03-14T12:34:56.789"` → `LocalDateTime.of(2017, 3, 14, 12, 34, 56, 789_000_000)`
| `java.time.LocalTime` | `"12:34:56.789"` → `LocalTime.of(12, 34, 56, 789_000_000)`
| `java.time.OffsetDateTime` | `"2017-03-14T12:34:56.789Z"` → `OffsetDateTime.of(2017, 3, 14, 12, 34, 56, 789_000_000, ZoneOffset.UTC)`
| `java.time.OffsetTime` | `"12:34:56.789Z"` → `OffsetTime.of(12, 34, 56, 789_000_000, ZoneOffset.UTC)`
| `java.time.Year` | `"2017"` → `Year.of(2017)`
| `java.time.YearMonth` | `"2017-03"` → `YearMonth.of(2017, 3)`
| `java.time.ZonedDateTime` | `"2017-03-14T12:34:56.789Z"` → `ZonedDateTime.of(2017, 3, 14, 12, 34, 56, 789_000_000, ZoneOffset.UTC)`
|===

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-explicit]]
===== Explicit Conversion

Instead of using implicit argument conversion you may explicitly specify an `ArgumentConverter` to use for a certain parameter using the `@ConvertWith` annotation like in the following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=explicit_conversion_example]
----

Explicit argument converters are meant to be implemented by test authors. Thus, `junit-jupiter-params` only provides a single explicit argument converter that may also serve as a reference implementation: `JavaTimeArgumentConverter`. It is used via the composed annotation `JavaTimeConversionPattern`.

[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=explicit_java_time_converter]

[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-display-names]]
==== Customizing Display Names

By default, the display name of a parameterized test invocation containers the invocation index and the `String` representation of all arguments. You can customize the invocation display names by using the `name` parameter of the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation like in the following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{testDir}/example/ParameterizedTestDemo.java[tags=custom_display_names]

----
Display name of container ✔
├─ 1 ==> first='foo', second=1 ✔
├─ 2 ==> first='bar', second=2 ✔
└─ 3 ==> first='baz, qux', second=3 ✔
----

The following placeholders are available:

[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Placeholder       | Description

| `{index}`         | the current invocation index (1-based)
| `{arguments}`     | the complete, comma-separated arguments list
| `{0}`, `{1}`, ... | an individual argument
|===


[[writing-tests-parameterized-tests-lifecycle-interop]]
==== Lifecycle and Interoperability

Each invocation of a parameterized test has the same lifecycle as regular `@Test` methods. For example, `@BeforeEach` methods will be executed before each invocation. Similar to <<writing-tests-dynamic-tests>>, invocations will appear one by one in the test tree of an IDE. You may at will mix regular `@Test` methods and `@ParameterizedTest` methods within the same test class.

You may use `ParameterResolver` extensions with `@ParameterizedTest` methods. However, method parameters that are resolved by argument sources need to come first in the argument list.

[[writing-tests-dynamic-tests]]
=== Dynamic Tests

The standard `@Test` annotation in JUnit Jupiter described in <<writing-tests-annotations>>
is very similar to the `@Test` annotation in JUnit 4.
Both describe methods that implement test cases.
These test cases are static in the sense that they are fully specified at compile time,
and their behavior cannot be changed by anything happening at runtime.
_Assumptions provide a basic form of dynamic behavior but are intentionally rather limited in their expressiveness._

In addition to these standard tests a completely new kind of test programming model has been introduced in JUnit Jupiter.
This new kind of test is a _dynamic test_ which is generated at runtime by a factory method
that is annotated with `@TestFactory`.

In contrast to `@Test` methods, a `@TestFactory` method is not itself a test case but rather a factory for test cases.
Thus, a dynamic test is the product of a factory.
Technically speaking, a `@TestFactory` method must return a `Stream`,
`Collection`, `Iterable`, or `Iterator` of `DynamicTest` instances.
These `DynamicTest` instances will then be executed lazily,
enabling dynamic and even non-deterministic generation of test cases.

Any `Stream` returned by a `@TestFactory` will be properly closed by calling `stream.close()`,
making it safe to use a resource such as `Files.lines()`.

As with `@Test` methods, `@TestFactory` methods must not be `private` or `static`
and may optionally declare parameters to be resolved by `ParameterResolvers`.

A `DynamicTest` is a test case generated at runtime.
It is composed of a _display name_ and an `Executable`. `Executable` is a `@FunctionalInterface`
which means that the implementations of dynamic tests can be provided as _lambda expressions_
or _method references_.

.Dynamic Test Lifecycle
WARNING: The execution lifecycle of a dynamic test is quite different than it is for a
standard `@Test` case. Specifically, there are not any lifecycle callbacks for dynamic
tests. This means that `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` methods and their corresponding
extension callbacks are not executed for dynamic tests. In other words, if you access
fields from the test instance within a lambda expression for a dynamic test, those fields
will not be reset by callback methods or extensions between the execution of dynamic
tests generated by the same `@TestFactory` method.

As of JUnit Jupiter {jupiter-version}, dynamic tests must always be created by factory
methods; however, this might be complemented by a registration facility in a later
release.

[[writing-tests-dynamic-tests-examples]]
==== Dynamic Test Examples

The following `DynamicTestsDemo` class demonstrates several examples of test factories and dynamic tests.

The first method returns an invalid return type. Since an invalid return type cannot be
detected at compile time, a `JUnitException` is thrown when it is detected at runtime.

The next five methods are very simple examples that demonstrate the generation of a
`Collection`, `Iterable`, `Iterator`, or `Stream` of `DynamicTest` instances.
Most of these examples do not really exhibit dynamic behavior
but merely demonstrate the supported return types in principle.
However, `dynamicTestsFromStream()` and `dynamicTestsFromIntStream()` demonstrate how
easy it is to generate dynamic tests for a given set of strings or a range of input numbers.

The last method is truly dynamic in nature.
`generateRandomNumberOfTests()` implements an `Iterator` that generates random numbers, a
display name generator, and a test executor and then provides all three to `DynamicTest.stream()`.
Although the non-deterministic behavior of `generateRandomNumberOfTests()` is of course in conflict with
test repeatability and should thus be used with care, it serves to demonstrate the expressiveness
and power of dynamic tests.
